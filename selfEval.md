# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
Nothing, thankfully. But nested objects and arrays always seem to trip me up a bit when trying to access specific levels, so I'll work on that some more.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
I'm taking good notes. They have been life saving. The best notes I'v utilized have come from the live lectures that weren't things that were convey through the written lessons. Some github notes I've taken have prevented likely a couple hours of research and problem solving.


- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
Always trying to solve the problem in my own code first.  Usually, I've been using google or stack overflow to push my understanding and try new methods or code arrangements.
